# Hello-World
My First Repository
My name is Nicholas Thompson. Im 35 years old and I live in a very small town called Belton. Its located in the upstate of South Carolina. All my computer training is self-taught except for a few months where I went to a small techical college to get my A+ Certification. Im hoping to become a master developer some day so any pointers from the pros will be very helpful. Thanks.
